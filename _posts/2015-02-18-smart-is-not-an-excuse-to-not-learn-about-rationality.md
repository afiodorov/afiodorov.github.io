Why intelligent people do foolish things, advocate unwise policies and believe
in nonsense?

Same reason not-so-intelligent people do all of the above. No surprise.

Being intelligent isn't the same as being rational. Being intelligent doesn't
even correlate with being rational [^1]. However, it is easier for an
intelligent person to apply methods of rationality.

As a consequence if you haven't learned instrumental rationality then chances
are you lack the methodology to arrive at accurate conclusions. That isn't
to say you are wrong, but I simply can't take your word for it. Neither should
you trust yourself as human minds are very fallible.

There is plenty of ways to arrive at wrong conclusions. Wiki has a
comprehensive list of [fallacies][2]. No one is shielded from them if they
aren't vigilant.

One of the most common pitfalls I observe is for an individual to be surrounded
by like-minded people who happen to have same views on a lot of things. People
fall into a trap of treating their views with more and more certainty. When in
doubt they consult their like-minded friends or read articles confirming their
views. Self-assuring groups form very quickly which are antagonistic to
groups who don't share their views.

Just a quick clarification what the term rationality means in this text:

* having an accurate model of the world, i.e. not believing
unsubstantiated statements; seeking all possible explanations for evidence at
hand
* updating the model accordingly with new knowledge, i.e. changing mind
* making optimal decisions. Decisions that reflect person's values and are
utilising his/her resources efficiency.

My summary of rationality has a lot of unexplained terms: what counts
as substantiated, what is an explanation, how to update the model and so forth.

Questions like this and many more have been asked and answered on the website
[lesswrong][1], a portal of intelligent (IQ ~140)[^2] people writing about
common pitfalls on the way to rationality.

It is an excellent place to start.
