title: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Brexit
---

With more and more facebook posts on the subject matter I gauge that people are
*worried*. Here's why I am not worried. And that's how you could be not
worried either.

**1)** Embrace the fact you live in an echo chamber. 99.9% of the people you choose
to engage with with already agree with you. Your thoughtful and informative
arguments will fall on deaf ears. You *almost certainly* underestimate this
effect. The actual maths behind the strength of your echo bubble has been
eloquently explained in the quote below:

**2)** Even if you managed to reach out to a person who doesn't agree with you -
you won't be able to persuade him/her.

The way we jump to conclusions has very little to do with reasoning. Face it,
the remain campaign has always made so much more sense to you - even though you
probably didn't go through a very detailed cost-benefit analysis involving a
myriad of numbers and highly speculative scenarios. And even if you did - you
shouldn't have. Because you are not impartial. You would find the remain side
more compelling anyway, because that's what you expect to find:

**3)** Down with reasoning! You can persuade by appealing to emotion:
by ridiculing the other side, by arguing that your enemies are
stupid/racist/chauvinistic and just downright evil ([they are not][not_evil]). Oh and don't forget to
mention Putin. Whilst you can, the opposing team **will** deploy exact same
tactics against your side and we'll be perpetually stuck drowning in vomit of
disgusting arguments. See any political debate ever - not only such a form of
persuasion has been shown to be to have very temporal effects on the recipients
but also leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth and ruins your credibility long
term.

**4)** Don't worry about polls saying the referendum will be a close one: trust
odd checkers instead. Media has long been exploiting the fact that articles that
cause strong dividing reaction are much more likely to spread. And across
various polls conducted in this country - you will only hear about those that
show that the referendum will be a close one. Those will get your blood
running! But the only reason it has reached you is because it got someone
else's blood running too. Read more about this phenomena at [The Taxoplasma Of
Rage][rage].

Bookmakers, however, have skin in the game. They aren't going to lose money
just to stoke up some controversy. And guess what: remain is winning by a large
margin. So time to relax and argue about the dragons in game of thrones.

**5)** Brexit or not - face it, you have very little control over the [final
decision][fin] and it's counterproductive to get emotionally involved in things you have
no control over. See the following excellent quote by Bryan Caplan:

> Stop paying attention to things that aggravate you unless (a) they
> concretely affect your life AND (b) you can realistically do something
> about them.  Start by ceasing to follow national and world news.

So yeah - aren't those dragons pretty cool?
