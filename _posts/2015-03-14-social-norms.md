title: Social norms in my PhD office
visible: 0

People are severely constrained by the obsession with what others think of them.
The obsession so is engrained in our tribal brains that we [adhere blindly][w]
to the social norms which we learned when we grew up.

This wouldn't be too bad if the social norms we developed were conducive to
advancing our society forward. That is the opposite of what has happened
however.  The non-argumentative social norms emerged under the constant
pressure to make a good impression. We learned to greet each other, have a
little chit-chat, congratulate each other on birthdays, avoid hurting each
other and just be nice to each other. The pressure to maintain a pleasant
atmosphere taught us to avoid saying what we think because it could be
offensive.

And boy people sure do get offended. People can get offended when they are
contradicted. People can get offended when their line of reasoning is brought
into question. People can get offended by misinterpreting sentences and by
body language. People get offended by not understanding jokes, by being
ignored and by a tone of voice. People can get offended by hearing
scientific hypotheses and by learning established scientific facts.

So we have all learned: to listen to bullshit, to not question and to not
argue. Agree to disagree is the way we are supposed to avoid heated discussions.

This works quite well in everyday situations. We don't often meet people who
are well-read with deep knowledge on interesting issues. Moreover, the line of
reasoning of an average Joe is not terribly impressive. Nothing of value to
discuss here: "Oh yeah, how has your day been? What's your weekend plans?".

But what happens when a group of people who are more than capable of reading
interesting material on things that matter, who have the agility of mind
to tell apart bad arguments from good arguments get together? Are they clever
enough to realise that the arbitrary social norms imposed on them needn't be
maintained any longer? No! Not at all! Serious discussions are still avoided
like the plague.

The "how are you" and the banter about types of biscuits and the expiry date
of penguin bars just never ends. I quite enjoy the banter where something
as trivial as the brand of tea is made into a big issue. The English irony of
making a mountain out of the molehill: the irony that indicates life can't be
taken too seriously. Sometimes the witty banter ends in discussing embarrassing
human anatomy which we all pretend we don't want to hear about, but, in
reality, don't mind. The humorous part is the fact that we are discussing
embarrassing things.

And it's all good. I am mostly happy with that. But time to time a terrible
realisation strikes. If the intellectuals are shying away from honestly
discussing things that matter, things that affect thousands or millions of
people then who will? Who will address the controversial issues? The people
with agenda will. And they will work hard to convince the general public of
their stance. Or no one will and the public will stay ignorant. And don't we
all love to discuss how stupid the general public is? But we don't like facing
the truth: even we, intellectuals, don't agree on many things. We never
discuss religion, abortion, racism, drugs and so on. And this is the
fundamental reason why we don't agree: because we don't discuss things beyond
stating our opinions. The discussions too often end at the first sign of
a genuine disagreement. But this is the point where it really matters.

We are shackled by the social norms which we carefully follow and maintain. We
don't look back and ask why the topic of penis jokes again. Why are we
acting as though we ought to maintain the arbitrary "be nice" mantra despite
[Aumann's agreement theorem][thm], which roughly speaking, says that two agents
acting rationally and with common knowledge of each other's beliefs cannot
agree to disagree.

The PhD office environment is an exciting place for arguments to happen: we have
clever individuals who are motivated to make a difference. People often fail
to separate attacks on their opinions and attacks on their personalities. But
what is good about the PhD environment is that while some might get offended:
the offence will have no future impact. We aren't really colleagues and we
work independently of each other. We often work in different fields so
our job prospects are separated. We are in a very good environment to adapt
different social norms to the rest of the society.

So we have the mental tools to resolve all the disagreements amongst each other
and then pick it up and destroy all the nonsense beliefs so commonly spread
amongst our friends and families. We have a perfect environment for it too.
What do we do instead? Everything but talking about things that affect
thousands of people everyday.

How our discussions could make a difference? In plenty of ways. By sorting out
the disagreements amongst each other we would be able to see why people
disagree on a bigger scale. We would have responses ready for people who
try to convince us of doing irrational things. In the end, we would facilitate the
excruciatingly slow process of spreading enlightening ideas from the
intellectuals to the general public.
