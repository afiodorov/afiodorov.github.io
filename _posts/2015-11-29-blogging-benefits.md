title: Benefits of having a blog
---

If you were thinking about writing for some time, but couldn't quite get yourself to do it, here's my take on it.

Having a blog turned out to have consequences I didn't not foresee.

Shortly after I started blogging a couple of (long-lost) people got in touch with me - so it expanded my social circle.

Another interesting consequence is that people who occasionally lurk through some content here sometimes bring it up when we meet and that's a path towards more interesting conversations.

I was originally worried about my content being unoriginal and low-quality, but it turns out however unoriginal my content is I can always put a spin on it by self-referencing, self-deprecating humour, like I am doing it right now.

Another way to shine a new light on content is by making it relatable and relevant via use of personal examples.

However, keep ["Nobody wants to read your shit"][shit] advise in mind. Remember though, it's just a guide on *how to write* rather than a call for not writing at all.
