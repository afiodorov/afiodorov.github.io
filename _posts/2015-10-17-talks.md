title: Talks on "Probability theory as an extension of logic"
---

Hey hey hey!

A short update from me.

Recently I gave 2 talks based on Jaynes' book: "Probability Theory: The Logic
of Science". First talk was one hour long and you can find my slides
[here][slides]. Second talk was 30 minutes long, and the slides are
[here][30slides]. I also wrote quite a lot about Jaynes' book in my
blog post ["If correlation does not imply causation, what does?"][corr]
previously.

Good day everyone!

P.S.

# Abstract

>                 Probability theory as an extension of logic
>
> In many problems we don't have enough information at hand to permit deductive
> reasoning. In this talk, I will introduce the idea of plausibility reasoning
> which focuses on processing incomplete information optimally. I will discuss
> how any system of plausibility reasoning that satisfies certain commonsense
> requirements is isomorphic to probability theory. I will examine the
> requirements carefully and then relate such interpretation of probability to
> other well-established approaches. Finally, I will look at a wide variety of
> applications, which include: Thermodynamics (why heat travels from hot to cold
> objects?), Statistics and also... everyday situations!
