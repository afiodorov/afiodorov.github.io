title: Meeting an investment banker
---

Recently I went to a meet-up event which was also attended by effective
altruists from various investment banks. The moment one of them revealed that
he is [one of those individuals][80000] who has gotten a high-earning career to donate a
significant proportion of his income to cost-effective charities the silent
"well-done" rippled through the air. The interlocutor highfived him. If I am
ever caught in a similar moment I will just break into applause.

What a difference effective altruism makes to the impression. I suspect bankers
don't often get highfived for revealing their trade.

I get warm fuzzies when I am thinking about a person griding away at a
stressful job in order to save lives. He mentioned that 2000Â£ buys a life,
though I know some charities claim $1000 per life ratio. He must have saved
dozens of lives already and will save many more. This gives me a reason to
feel good about humanity.

But it gets even better: he told us that about 10% of the new-hirers are
effective altruists: they peruse [GiveWell][gw] website for poverty-alleviation
cost-effective charities, some read LessWrong's[^1] effective altruism posts
and some find Peter Singer [Ted talk][talk]/[book][book] influential. I am sure
there's plenty of other resources out there I just named the ones which were
mentioned.

The 10% figure is just amazing and makes me feel good. This post is for
spreading the "feel-good" feeling which I am currently feeling. It ties in
nicely with something else which was on my mind for some time: when asked "What
place would you go to if you could go anywhere?" I said "Space." I never got
round explaining why going to Space (or International Space Station) was my
answer.

When I get a commercial flight I still experience "yay for humanity" emotion.
Everytime. When I get home I read wiki about ailerons, about history of
commercial aviation, about types of jet there are. It fascinates me that we
invented jets and made flights accessible to the general public. Arguably I
should feel the same about smartphones and internet daily, but I just don't.

And I would get exact same "yay for humanity" feeling if a rocket accelerated
my body to a delta-v speed of 9.4km/s and put me in the low orbit. Moreover I'd
be given access to a permanently manned space station and I'd feel even more
awesome. Hell, I might actually die from all the awesomeness I'd feel stemming
from what humans are capable of.

On the contrary, I would be rather upset about travelling to a poverty-stricken
area. It is the opposite feeling that would embrace me: how humanity is **not**
awesome. Down-right terrible in fact. I feel enough of that.

I used to "diss" charities exhibiting [just-world][jw] bias but I am changing
now. Moreover, the recent encounters motivated me too look into the alternative
altruism movement. May be, one day, I will join them.
