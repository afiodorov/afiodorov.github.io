title: Announcing Thoughful3
---

I spent last 6 days creating [Thoughful3][Thoughful3].
It's basically Twitter but it is hosted on Ethereum blockchain and thus is very
expensive. Like $8 per Tweet that you have to pay the crypto miners to embed
your thoughts into the blockchain. I think it's a feature actually: with such
high prices no problem with spam accounts.

Why? I like the idea of embedding your thoughts into Ethereum forever. Whatever
I post there is likely to outlive me. Also this is truly censorship resistant.
So if you need to complain about evil governments: go ahead (but it'll cost
you $8 per 300 characters). Anyway I've always wanted to make a Web3 app, i.e.
a decentralised app. This is my first (Web3 and Thoughful is the reason for the
name). Underneath I am using [thegraph][thegraph]. I used vyper for the
smartcontract & pure typescript (no libraries like React) for the front end.
Code of the project can be found [here][Code].

I didn't know much about Metamask (extension that allows you to interact with
Ethereum network) nor modern JavaScript 6 days ago and heavily used ChatGPT3 to
generate boilerplate code for me & used DALL-E to generate a logo.
