## I.

Isn't the humanity awesome? I am writing this entry and it is instantaneously
accessible to billions of people. I am writing this at a comfort of my home,
all warm and cosy whilst having a love cup of tea. The number of man-hours
spent on making all of this possible is tremendous. Yet I am taking this all
for granted. Every day.

But there is always a but. Underneath the awesome part which is on the surface
there is doom and gloom. It is not very difficult to find the misery just round
the corner. And this misery is akin to a huge, massive black gooey substance
that is kinda underneath everything and it is not difficult to spot, but we
prefer to just not look down.

But why the gooey, sticky, black horrible substance that is underneath the
"awesome" part? Is it unavoidable? How?

## II.

I am not a history buff, but it seems to me that the history of human conflict
is about misaligned beliefs. Because we are all good people. We'd like to think
that we are making the world a better place or, at the very least, not making
it substantially worst, even if it involves burning witches, gassing Jews,
massacring Indians, blowing up innocent people and so forth. What doesn't
always coincide is our views whether burning witches, gassing Jews, massacring
Indians and blowing up innocent people actually makes the world a better place.
Whilst is is entirely obvious to you and I that it doesn't make the world and
better place, and wasn't and isn't entirely obvious to the people who persist
on "making the world a better place".

Here is Scott Alexander's take on what would happen if you could read people's
minds:

But surely we have got it figured it out by now. History has taught us. We know
the modern morals and anyone who still doesn't see it this way is an obsolete
douche bag who'd better just disappeared already. Or, at the very leas, shut
the fuck up.

You are not digging deep enough.

When I read about atrocities of the previous century I really really really
wish that at some point people would just all stop all together. Just said to
their bosses in charge: "no more" and that would be it. Why would they do such
a thing?  Because the eyes of historians would be on them. The eyes of their
children and grand children and grand grand children who'd peruse the terrible
terrible history again again and wished that, well, their grand grand fathers
and mothers just felt the heavy burden of shame and selflessly refused to carry
on or selflessly chose to interfere at their own peril.

But they didn't care. And here comes the inductive step. You will probably have
grand grand children. Who will read the history books about you and the era you
lived in. And there is also a significant chance that they will come a
conclusion that their grandparents were inconsiderate assholes too. Once they
read the history books they will see the gooey black substance that was
underneath everything that people walked on pretending to ignore.

## IV.

Okay, may be we haven't yet quite finally figured it out yet but we are almost
there morality wise. But they are good enough right? People are mostly safe,
relatively wealthy and not discriminated against. May be I got carried away and
the last part is still in progress.
