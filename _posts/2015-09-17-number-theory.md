title: Why using number theory as an example of useful pure maths is not compelling
visible: 1
---

This is a short summary of ideas lazily taken from
[this thread](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4kt/the_value_of_theoretical_research/).

The usual argument for funding pure maths goes:

> Much maths is practically important today. The maths I am working on is not
> practically important today, but maybe it will be the maths that is practically
> important tomorrow. How can we predict what will be useful? It seems like
> pushing maths generally forward is the best response to this uncertainty.

And usually number-theory pops up as an example of above phenomena and trumps
all the objections. Here's some thoughts of a mathematician working in the
field:

> I'm a number theorist and I don't find this argument compelling. Much of the
> number theory that is used in crypto is not deep. There's nothing about
> Diffie-Hellman or RSA that requires the hundreds of years of number theory
> research that has gone into it. One could explain the algorithms for such
> procedures to a mathematician in the early 1800s with little effort (although
> the idea of having very efficient methods of arithmetic might strike them as
> very odd). Moreover, while other parts of number theory have turned out to be
> relevant it is still a very tiny fraction of all number theory.

Other objections to the original argument are relevant too:

> You could just as well wait until the application appears and then do the maths.

And concerns about the lack of proper cost-benefit analysis pop up:

> There is a fact that a lot of pure math does not (or havent yet
> anyways) lead to applications. It pays to put effort only into math that is
> immediately practically useful.
>
> We need proper counterfactuals here, cases where a practical use of math
> counterfactually would not have been possible without previous development as
> pure math. And also, what-if the pure mathematicians have been directly working
> on practical math instead?

## And the point of it all?

That a proper cost-benefit analysis of the value of research in pure maths is long
overdue. Using number-theory as an example is just not convincing enough.
