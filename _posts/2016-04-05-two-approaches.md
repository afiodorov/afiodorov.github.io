title: Two approaches to programming
---

There are two approaches to ~~programming~~ life in general when it comes to
resolving issues.

First one is: get the hell on with it. The engineer's mindset. Who cares if
it's suboptimal or if it's just reinventing the wheel (again). Just fucking
do it. Don't google about it, don't read and don't ask. There's you, there's
this keyboard and there will be code.

And the second one is? Academic. Probably someone on this planet has had this
problem before. And perhaps that someone was nice enough to document his
solution. Even better, there was a poor-ass PhD who spent a couple of years
thinking about just this problem, solving every edge case of it and inventing
the most optimal solution ever. The challenge is to find it, to understand it
and to re-use it.

And obviously life offers no absolutes and the optimal approach is
problem-dependant. However we all have our tendencies for one or another. I
just realised I am more of an academic type. I quietly accumulate knowledge
so that if I ever need to sort by two fields simultaneously I apply a search by
the first field and then a stable search by the second. And then do a little
smug dance in my head: Ha-ha! I knew that blog-post/book chapter would
eventually pay off and there's got to be a poor soul on this planet debugging
his deep recurrence thinking what a clever-ass he is for solving such a
challenging problem. I hope you can forgive me for such an occasional bout of
smugness.

But it's not good to be too academic-minded either. In a search of the best
solution known to the humankind I am wasting my time as it's often unnecessary
to solve the problem that I have in the best way possible. What's amazing about
life is that the most intuitive and simple solution that you implement... just
works and it's good enough. Beats me every time.

This brings me to the essay that I really enjoyed reading. The essay is publish
by Prometheus Society which is a high IQ society but much more restrictive than
Mensa. They also have a journal with a heavy focus on the topic of
intelligence. In [The Changing Face of Intelligence][face] the author tells us
how society's idea of intelligence has changed over time. In the past abundant
and snap memory used to be more valuable than it is now, hence the notion of
intelligence was strongly attributed to having good memory. Recently the idea
of intelligence has shifted away from just having a good memory more towards
fluency: ability to solve puzzles quickly, infamously used  by recruiters at
many big tech companies (until recently - I heard Google stopped using
brain-teasers now, which means every self-respecting tech company now must
follow the lead. Snap.). Finally, the author argues that the trait he calls
"resourcefulness", which is the ability to quickly find relevant information
and make use of it will become the defining characteristic of the intelligence
in the nearest future:

> The body of modern knowledge is enormous—too huge for one individual to
> master—even 5 lifetimes; continual advancement, especially in the technologies,
> assures that every man will always be "slightly ignorant" (even regarding the
> developments in his own specialty) and that, inevitably, he will often need to
> consult references for an explanation of new discoveries. The efficient use of
> such reference sources, necessary for adaptation to an ever-changing society,
> is of vital practical importance; gaining access to the facts of interest, when
> (abundant) information is stored in a complex manner, is facilitated by a
> divergent type of thinking called "resourcefulness." This "resourcefulness," as
> a key determinant of success in the modern world, may be a valid criterion by
> which to evaluate adult intelligence. - See more at:

> <cite>C. L. Frost</cite>

And there you have it. The academic approach is THE WAY, says Frost. Well,
thank you Mr. Frost, I feel better now.

Thanks for reading, baduabum tish.
