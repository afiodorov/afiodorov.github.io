title: Against value systems
---

Time and time again I engage in some sort of dialogue lately - it becomes
apparent within minutes my interlocutor and I have a big inferential distance.
Pretty much any disagreement boils down to the fact that we don't use same
assumptions and same methods for deriving our conclusions.

It is apparent that vast majority is still using a value ethical system - a
system where a list of values, such as diversity, tolerance, gender-equality,
gay-friendliness are good things. And they *are* good things. However, the
scary thing is that they haven't always been considered good things. Doesn't a
mere idea that you could have been homophobic, racist, intolerant or sexist had
you been born and raised in some different time or some different place scare
you greatly? It gives me goose bumps. The following example resonates with me
greatly because it highlights that our moral intuitions shouldn't be trusted:

> "It is traditional to attribute this to â€œpeople being immoral", but in fact
> people are generally very moral: they feel intense moral outrage at the
> suffering in the world, they are extremely generous in response to certain
> obvious opportunities for generosity like the Haitian earthquake, and many
> people will, in an emergency that calls for it, sacrifice their lives to save
> others with only a split second's thought. And even things that are in fact
> repulsive, like the intensity with which people oppose gay marriage, derive
> from a misplaced sense that they are doing the right and moral thing; people
> will devote their entire careers to opposing gay marriage even though it does
> not hurt them personally because they feel like they should. The problem isn't
> that people aren't trying to be moral, it's that they're no good at it."

I really wish we could all agree that value systems are rubbish - they failed
humanity so many times and they are still failing humanity in so many places
around the world.

My favourite moral system is consequentialism: it's a system which says that a
moral, right belief is the one which makes the world better. Gay-friendly
society is good because it greatly increases the well-being of gays and it is
harmless to everyone else. It sounds like such an obvious moral system - but
it's not the most adopted moral system, the value system is. Go figure.

Have you heard the kind of arguments where people admit that action X might be
good, but it is just not right? My favourite bit about consequentialism is that
it kills the distinction: good is right. There are no more "it ain't right"
statements that could convince me - but it is a gigantic effort to explain why
such arguments shouldn't be used.

The best intro into consequentialism I found is below. It is long, but even if
you read parts of it - you will find something interesting.
