title: List of things I bought which are excellent value for money
---

I decided to put down some things which served me well and provided much
utility for their price. Hopefully I will be constantly updating this list.
Only items which I have had for at least 6 months will be on the list.

## 1) Usb stick / bottle opener keyring

*Price: £10.*

*Reasons:*

I used to have gimmicky keyrings in the past but they stopped being amusing
after a couple of weeks and I was left with carrying a prickly object all day
for a faint smile of friends once in a while as a reward. One day I decided I
needed a practical keyring and that's what I found on amazon. Combining boozing
with computing... Why not?

Both uses served me well: I surprisingly often found myself in situations where
I was the only one with such objects available (may be I should stop drinking
alone in front of my computer). For bonus brownie points I made the usb stick
bootable - and this helped me and a couple of friends recover files from their
broken PCs. And I opened a couple beers afterwards to celebrate: this is the
life!

## 2) Chromecast

*Price: £30.*

*What the hell is it?*

A little stick which connects to your wifi network and your TV and transforms
it into a smart TV by providing access to the iPlayer, YouTube, Netflix and
more.

*Reasons:*

Even though it could easily be replaced by an HDMI cable - HDMI cables are
hassly and not hip. And so I was left in some archaic state with terrestrial TV
to watch. This dongle brought me back and I am with the times again. Chromecast
enables anyone at home with a laptop / mobile device to take charge of the
entertainment with a click/tap of a button.

As a bonus it converts a TV into a picture frame (with a mixture of
personal pictures taken from the Google cloud or just amazing pictures from the
internet) - this alone could be worth the price. All the pictures I have
ever taken got a new lease of life - they were enjoyable again even after
bragging using them on Facebook.

## 3) Dell 11.6" Chromebook (4GB ram)

*Price: £235.*

*Reasons:*

Because it has a battery life of a Macbook Air/Ultrabook but costs 1/4 as much.
I originally bought this as my travel companion but used it as my primary
laptop ever since.

The main objection to Chromebooks I hear is the limited Chrome OS. And it's a
valid objection. However I would like to remind my readers that side by side
comparisons often lead to a disproportionate weight assigned to characteristics
that differentiate products. "Wouldn't it be cool if my laptop lasted as long
as my tablet", - I thought to myself one day. I googled for a laptop with
longest battery life, YOLO'd for life and bought the item. No regrets.

As a bonus: you can install a regular linux distribution on it and it will work
perfectly alongside the Chrome OS. I did that and I now have access to both
operating systems. It might seem a bit unscrupulous that I am recommending this
device then. Skype used to be not available on Chrome OS - and that's why I
used the linux. Now that Skype is [available][skype] my conscientiousness
"is clean", as Russians say, for recommending this to you.

## 4) Cateye Velo 5 Cycling Computer

*Price: £13.*

*Reasons:*

First of all it's not a computer but Cateye disagrees. It's a speedometer: it
measures speed and distance when you cycle. And it's amazing. Watching the
accumulated distance grow every time I cycle gives me a new meaning to life.

Apart from the accumulated distance I love knowing how fast I am going and
how fast I have ever went. I like comparing distances of different routes,
knowing how much I cycled every day, where the middle point of each
route is and how badly the wind effects my usual routine. I wish I could
communicate better why having a speedometer is awesome, but I can't. It just
is.

## Conclusion

There is no conclusion. Perhaps make your own list one day and share utility
with the rest of us.
