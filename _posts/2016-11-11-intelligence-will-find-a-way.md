title: Intelligence will find a way
---

"Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!" is a fascinating read or, in my case,
listen (audiobook)[^1]. And what I found most remarkable was Feynman's ability
to pick up new skills. Fixing radios, lock-picking, mental arithmetic,
Portuguese, biology, drawing and drumming to name a few. What made him so good
at it?

My thesis is his general intelligence. And by that I don't mean that he was
capable of processing information in his head at superhuman speeds. On the
contrary his foray into mental arithmetic showed that the key to computing fast
in your head is spotting various computational shortcuts and memorizing various
precomputed values.

When faced with a challenge he came up with various mental techniques, certain
shortcuts to make his learning efficient. His intelligence found a
better-than-average way of resolving the problems he was facing.

Time for a personal revelation to convince you that my thesis is absolutely
true, because this is how blogging works.

Shortly after I finished Coursera's course "Learning How To
Learn" I came to a realization that I discovered most of the good
learning techniques on my own. Thus I was a good student. And I also observed
other students doing the things the author of the course told us not to do:
rereading the material many times, excessive highlighting and cramming. And
they were mostly average/struggling students, many spending just as much time
preparing for exams as me (or more!). Learning technique matters.

And so that I come across humble (that is how *good* blogging works[^2]) let me
remark that by the time I reached the university I had had plenty of
opportunities to improve my methods of independent learning through trial and
error. Hence I don't claim to posses Feynman's level of general
intelligence. By the time I started the university I had finished a couple of
correspondence courses, learned 2 foreign languages (as an adult) and
participated in various extracurricular schools where I was expected to pick up
things and use them with very little guidance, integration and differentiation
was one of them. And I remember deriving various volume formulas, coming up
with concrete examples and practicing explaining those two concepts until they
became obvious.

The path to efficient self-learning was not smooth. Most vividly I remember
countless lists of Lithuanian words that I kept memorizing by simply reading
over them again and again. I was about 16 when I discovered an internet forum
of polyglots that made me reevaluate everything I knew about language learning.
I started practicing flash cards, immersion and other methods and I saw big
improvements in my skill of picking up foreign languages.

My intelligence found a way to navigate through space of possible actions
towards a desirable outcome.
Thus after reading the book I internalized Eliezer's definition of
intelligence, which is "the ability to steer the future so it hits that
small target of desired outcomes in the large space of all possible outcomes,
using fewer resources as possible".

And so that I don't come across tautological: Feynman's intelligence
made him efficient at learning new skills because being efficient at learning
new skills *is* intelligence; let me spell it out: it is a certain
configuration of neurons in his head that made him discover efficient learning
techniques. The same configuration that also played a role in his scientific
discoveries.

And I think this is a *good* thing. I was so relieved to learn that Feynman had
no special powers when it came to mental arithmetic. It is all just a bag of
tricks. A bag of tricks you and I can learn and even discover on our own. The
competitive advantage of learning a particular skill of people like Feynman
vanishes the moment they disclose their tricks.

P.S. High IQ people might still trump you when it comes to learning a new skill. C'est la vie.

[^1]: Big thanks to a person who presented me this book as a Secret Santa present
      X years ago. Even though I didn't end up reading it, that physical copy had
      been reminding me that I should ever since I got it.

[^2]: I have much more positive view of Scott Alexander compared to Eliezer
      Yudkowski and I suspect humility in his writing is the reason.
