BBC broadcast [climate change by numbers][iplayer] documentary recently,
where Dr [Hannah Fry][fry], Prof [Norman Fenton][fenton] and
Prof [David Spiegelhalter][spiel] tried to address the consensus gap[^1], i.e.
the difference between the public's perception of how much agreement there is
among scientists that humans are causing global warming compared to the
scientific consensus. The documentary talked about the mathematics
which was used to highlight that the climate change *is happening*[^4].

However, the producers of the program failed to address why people are
still sceptical of the climate change. People indicate scepticism to highlight
that they belong to a certain group. Their scepticism is like [clothes][attire]
which signal their stance on public policies rather than the actual
disagreement. The following quote summarises the idea well

The documentary has already been labelled as [propaganda][notalotofpeople]
amongst the climate sceptics who inherently distrust BBC.  Even though the BBC
and the mainstream media haven't got the best track record on accuracy[^2], BBC
reporting on anything being true is a chance for conspiracy theorists to
exercise [reverse stupidity mistaken for intelligence][reversed] and use it
as counter-evidence.

#### What should be done instead?

It is high time we moved on from the political debate dressed up as a
scientific one to the core of the disagreement. Instead of arguing about
how much humans are changing the climate, here is a list of some questions I
would like to hear more about

* How will the climate change proceed in the future and how certain we are of
the forecasts?
* What will be the consequences of the change in climate?
* What should be done about it?

Basic stuff like what are our options and what will those options lead to.

After all, arguing about the fact that CO2 emissions have caused the climate to
change hides the real question: is reducing CO2 emissions the *best way* to
stop the harm which will be caused by global warming?

#### Climate change and rationality

The BBC documentary will have some impact. What is rather unfortunate is that
[cognitive biases][darkarts] can be abused to change opinions too:

> There have been a number of studies that have shown that some people will
> change their views of climate change based on extreme weather. It's not
> enough to simply experience a heat wave — it then needs to be contextualized.
> It needs to be interpreted by thought leaders and trusted people in a
> community and by the media and scientists saying, 'This is an indication of
> global warming'

I see one long-term solution to this problem: spread ideas of rationality. This
is the reason this blog exists.

[^2]: This statement deserves a separate post with a long list of evidence.
    However, as of now I would like to point out that both the West and
    the USSR were using mainstream media to distort public opinions during
    the Cold War. Did the collapse of USSR suddenly change the way the media
    operated in the West? My answer is *unlikely*.

    great material on human psychology/rationality rather than just the issue
    of climate change
